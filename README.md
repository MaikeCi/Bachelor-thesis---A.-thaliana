# Bachelor-thesis---A.-thaliana
this is a R script for the statistical analysis of 2 datasets ("Shoot" for older plants with a shoot,"noShoot" for younger plants without a shoot)
each of them contain measured values for different characteristics of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana L..
The goal is to see, if there are any interesting correlations between any of the measured/calculated characteristics and to plot them nicely for using them for a practical module report / bachelors thesis.
